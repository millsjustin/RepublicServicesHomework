Republic Services Take Home Challenge:

Your task is to build an Android application taking advantage of the clean architecture principles and best practices. You can use any of the Jetpack libraries but use other third-party libraries only if necessary. 

REST API endpoint: https://d49c3a78-a4f2-437d-bf72-569334dea17c.mock.pstmn.io/data

General Requirements:
Call the remote API endpoint mentioned above.
Save driver and routes data in the local database.
Package name should include your last name (ie com.smith)

Main Screen:
Display the list of drivers from the local database. 
Have a button in the top right corner which sorts the drivers based on their last name.
When the user selects one driver, the Route screen is presented, and her/his route/routes is displayed based on the following algorithm (business logic):
If the driver id is the same as the route id then display the route.
If the driver id is divisible by 2 then show the first R type route.
If the driver id is divisible by 5 then display the second C type route.
If the driver id doesnâ€™t meet any of the conditions above, then show the last I type route.

Routes Screen: 
Displays the route information (type and name of route) for the selected driver based on the business logic above.
